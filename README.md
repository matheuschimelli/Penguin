# Penguin
Penguin is a friendly kitsune's fork(after the original project is dead) PHP implementation of Club Penguin's latest protocol.


## Prerequisites
* PHP version â‰¥ 5.6
  * PHP 5.6 (as of writing this) is bundled with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/).
  * You'll want to install or enable the cURL extension, which may involve installing the ```php5-curl``` package on GNU/Linux distributions.
* MySQL server
  * MariaDB (which works) is also bundled with XAMPP.

## Configuration
Edit **Database.xml** to conform to your database installation.

##Contribute

Contribution is very welcome. To do this, make a fork and then a pull request. There is a lot of work to be done.

##WHY?
After Club Penguin (not Island Club Penguin) from Disney was closed, this is a community maitened server emulator for remeber the good old days of CP(if you played cp on 2006-2008 you know what im saying).
